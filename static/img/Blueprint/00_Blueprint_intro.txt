Blueprint
Bag design for Designer 

Blueprint Bag changes the concept we cast on this kind of items in the past-- occupy lots of space and only single function, combined with space you can take in  professional designer's stationeries and basic commodities, we design a new type of bag to meet specific roles in specific situations. This comprehensively designed bag allows to putting in artworks, blueprints, posters, used while commuting, working situations; also very suitable for outdoor recreation.
    On the selection of materials, we choose thick canvas with waterproof coating and the special waterproof zipper to enhance durability and prevent the objects from being wet. The bag is featured with exclusive zinc alloy buckle to give it sophisticated looking. We also plan a space inside the bag for iPad and other mobile devices, not just a blueprint tube bag it also can be used as the iPad carrier.
    Designers consider the overall shape of simplicity, what might be carried by creative workers, how these things will be placed and be taken out from a bag to achieve the most fluent body language. Blueprint Bag configurations accurately depict the interactions between people and things.
